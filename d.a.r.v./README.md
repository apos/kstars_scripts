# Simple indi D.A.R.V script

D.A.R.V is a simple and yet very fast polar alignment method if you habe no sight to the north / south celestial pole. Requires sight to South or North at approximately 0째 Declination and East _or_ West at approximately 0째 Declination.

Unfortunately EKOS does not support it. Fortunately, indi is scriptable: https://indilib.org/develop/developer-manual/104-scripting.html , and I did it :-) Feel free to mail me your ideas or post at _this_ thread - no crossposts supported (really!) ;-)

----------------
### WARNING: do not leave this script run unattend! There is no error handling, so aborting might let your mount move forever. ALWAYS be prepared to STOP you mount.  
----------------


## Usage

Put both scripts into the same directory and make them executable (chmod +755 darv*.sh). The script take only one argument with one character: s, e or w. 

#### Example: 

    darv_indi.sh s

First of all all all motions are aborted. Then the script moves the mount _near_ (not exactly in the moment!) south and DEC 0째. It then asks you, if you want to continue. This gives you the chance to reconsider, focus, chosse a certain star (e.g. run capture an solve).

The script runs completely independent of a runnings EKOS instance, hence it uses the same running instance of the standard indi server. 


## Principals and the method of D.A.R.V.

## What the script does, what not
 
 * moves to south, east, west near DEC 0째.
 * uses a given indi scope for movement commands
 * uses a given indi cam for long time exposure
 * uses a given time for the exposure, the pause for the "star dot" and the slew speed during the exposure

 * Does _not_ search a star for you 


The settings must be altered at the beginning of the script:

#### Scope and cam

    indi_telescope="Telescope Simulator"  # put indi name of your scope here (long name)
    indi_cam="CCD Simulator"  # put indi name of your scope here (long name)
 
#### Photo parameters for d.a.r.v.

    photoTime=10             # exposure time alltogether (point,  move west, move east) - best: 125 sec
    pointTime=2              # time to make a "point" at the picture (movement stopped) - best  5 sec
    photoSlewSpeed="2x"      # 1x, 2x,3x 4x (with simulator, use indi_getprop for all actual settings) 

#### Declination Offset (degree) - use, if region is not visible

    decOffsetNS=0
    decOffsetWE=3
